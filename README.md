# Open biodiversity data publication by biodiversity.aq 


## Rationale

ðŸ‘‹ We are the data publication team of [biodiversity.aq](https://www.biodiversity.aq/) and we publish **antarctic biodiversity data** as open data. 

The types of biodiversity data that we work with are: 

- occurrences (e.g. observations) 
- checklists (e.g. species lists)
- sampling events
- sequence-derived biodiversity data

which we document with metadata, format to the international [Darwin Core](https://www.gbif.org/darwin-core) standard, publish on the [biodiversity.aq IPT](https://ipt.biodiversity.aq/) as open data. These data will be registered with the [Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)](https://www.gbif.org) and harvested by [OBIS](https://obis.org/) (if it contains marine data) for discovery.

In this repository we keep track of [issues](https://github.com/biodiversity-aq/data-publication/issues) for published datasets. If you have questions or remarks [leave an issue](https://github.com/biodiversity-aq/data-publication/issues) or send us an email at ðŸ“§ data-biodiversity-aq@naturalsciences.be.

## Datasets

Most of the datasets for which we provide technical support are hosted on the biodiversity.aq IPT.

- [Datasets on the IPT](https://ipt.biodiversity.aq/): where datasets are published
- [Datasets on GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/installation/27c24cba-13c5-47d1-96a1-16abd8f11437): where datasets are discoverable and interoperable
- [Datasets on OBIS](https://obis.org/node/dc6c6ea2-83f5-4b18-985a-9efff6320d69): where datasets are discoverable and interoperable


## Guidelines

We are working on a [guidelines/best practices for data providers and ourselves](https://github.com/ymgan/data-fairy) as well as documentation for our data publication practice on the wiki page.
